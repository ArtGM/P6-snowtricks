Even in cases where spins are performed on unconventional obstacles, the rotation is regarded as the nearest increment of 180째, and can be identified by the direction of approach and landing (regular and switch). A spin attempted from a jump to a rail is the only time a spin can be referred to in a 90-degree increment, examples: 270 (between a 180 and 360-degree spin) or 450 (between a 360 and 540-degree spin). These spins can be frontside, backside, cab, or switch-backside just like any other spins. In April 2015 British snowboarder and Winter Olympic medallist Billy Morgan demonstrated the world\'s first quadruple cork 1800, the biggest spin ever'

However, because snowboards don\'t have trucks, the term grind doesn\'t apply to these types of maneuvers. They can still be called grinds. '

Derived from the snowboarder Chris Roach of Grass Valley, CA. Other notable riders who popularized this air include snowboarders Jamie Lynn, Shaun Palmer, Terry Kidwell, and skateboarders Steve Caballero and Christian Hosoi.

A Double-Cork refers to a rotation in which a snowboarder inverts or orients themselves sideways at two distinct times during an aerial rotation. David Benedek is the originator of the Double-Cork in the Half-pipe, but the Double-Cork is also a very common trick in Big-Air competitions. Shaun White is known for making this trick famous in the half-pipe. Several snowboarders have recently extended the limits of technical snowboarding by performing triple-cork variations, Torstein Horgmo being the first to land one in competition. Mark McMorris originated Backside Triple-Cork 1440\'s in 2011. In April 2015 British snowboarder and Winter Olympic medallist Billy Morgan demonstrated the world\'s first quadruple cork 1800.',
